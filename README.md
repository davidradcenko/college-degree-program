INTRODUCTION


One of the most important strategic aspects of the company's activity on the Internet, which needs constant development, is the timely creation of a corporate website and its constant support. The likelihood of achieving the desired results will increase significantly if the site owners understand its purpose.
The need to create a website arose due to the fact that when recruiting new students, a large number of people come to apply and fill out a questionnaire, and a large queue of people is recruited, so it was decided to make a software product in which applicants can fill out a questionnaire, and for that so that users can easily get access to filling out the questionnaire, it was decided to make a website "Applicant 2020".
To accomplish this task, I chose the Java programming system to implement data processing and saving to the database, as well as the html markup language, the CSS style sheet language and the JavaScript programming language.
To implement the task, it is required to solve the following tasks:
 - study the subject area;
 - create a database;
 - design an interface;
 - bind the interface to the code;
 - link the program to the database;
 - test the program;
 - upload the project to the local server.
When working with the software, the user will be able to prematurely fill out an application form for admission, get acquainted with possible specialties, follow the enrollment competition, chat with other applicants, and follow the events upon admission.


1.2 Input information


When designing a site, the input information should include the content of the site, which the administrator puts directly on the site itself:
- filling out the applicant's questionnaire;
- information about specialties;
- information when the open day is taking place.

1.3 Imprint

To create a website that meets all the needs and requirements of the customer, the output information must contain information about the applications sent by customers to enroll their child in classes or training courses:
- Derivation of the schedule of days of open doors;
- the results of the competition;
- data of applicants' questionnaires;
- the name of the applicant;
- average score;
- a list of the best applicants by year.
