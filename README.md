Formulation of the problem
 

 The database should contain information about teachers, the daily schedule of pairs with the indication of teachers. You also need to take into account the conduct of classes with division into subgroups. Implement the calculation of hours worked for a specific teacher for a period of time
When developing this software tool, the following tasks had to be completed:
 design a database to store information about teachers, disciplines, groups, schedules and replacements in it.
 develop a database that allows you to store information about teachers, disciplines, groups, schedules and replacements in it
 develop an application containing forms for correctly filling out reference information in the program, including information about teachers, disciplines, groups, schedules and replacements with the ability to add, edit and delete it;
 develop forms containing reports on the entered information in a form convenient for analysis.
To accomplish these tasks requires a database management system that supports the relational database model. The statement of the problem provides for the development of a client-server application, therefore, Visual Studio 2019 was chosen as a database management system - a modern management system for both local relational databases and client-server databases. It is also supposed to develop a server database. To develop a database of such architecture, it is possible to use MS SQLServer 2017 Express.
